(#) Layout names should be prefixed accordingly.

!!! WARNING: Layout names should be prefixed accordingly.
   This is a warning.

Id
:   `WrongLayoutName`
Summary
:   Layout names should be prefixed accordingly.
Severity
:   Warning
Category
:   Correctness
Platform
:   Android
Vendor
:   vanniktech/lint-rules/
Feedback
:   https://github.com/vanniktech/lint-rules/issues
Min
:   Lint 8.0 and 8.1
Compiled
:   Lint 8.0 and 8.1
Artifact
:   [com.vanniktech:lint-rules-android](com_vanniktech_lint-rules-android.md.html)

Affects
:   Resource files
Editing
:   This check runs on the fly in the IDE editor

The layout file name should be prefixed with one of the following:
activity_, view_, fragment_, dialog_, bottom_sheet_, adapter_item_,
divider_, space_, popup_window_. This will improve consistency in your
code base as well as enforce a certain structure.

(##) Including

!!!
   This is not a built-in check. To include it, add the below dependency
   to your project. This lint check is included in the lint documentation,
   but the Android team may or may not agree with its recommendations.

```
// build.gradle.kts
lintChecks("com.vanniktech:lint-rules-android:0.25.0")

// build.gradle
lintChecks 'com.vanniktech:lint-rules-android:0.25.0'

// build.gradle.kts with version catalogs:
lintChecks(libs.lint-rules-android)

# libs.versions.toml
[versions]
lint-rules-android = "0.25.0"
[libraries]
lint-rules-android = {
    module = "com.vanniktech:lint-rules-android",
    version.ref = "lint-rules-android"
}
```

0.25.0 is the version this documentation was generated from;
there may be newer versions available.

(##) Suppressing

You can suppress false positives using one of the following mechanisms:

* Adding the suppression attribute `tools:ignore="WrongLayoutName"` on
  the problematic XML element (or one of its enclosing elements). You
  may also need to add the following namespace declaration on the root
  element in the XML file if it's not already there:
  `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"`.

* Using a special `lint.xml` file in the source tree which turns off
  the check in that folder and any sub folder. A simple file might look
  like this:
  ```xml
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;lint&gt;
      &lt;issue id="WrongLayoutName" severity="ignore" /&gt;
  &lt;/lint&gt;
  ```
  Instead of `ignore` you can also change the severity here, for
  example from `error` to `warning`. You can find additional
  documentation on how to filter issues by path, regular expression and
  so on
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/lintxml.md.html).

* In Gradle projects, using the DSL syntax to configure lint. For
  example, you can use something like
  ```gradle
  lintOptions {
      disable 'WrongLayoutName'
  }
  ```
  In Android projects this should be nested inside an `android { }`
  block.

* For manual invocations of `lint`, using the `--ignore` flag:
  ```
  $ lint --ignore WrongLayoutName ...`
  ```

* Last, but not least, using baselines, as discussed
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/baselines.md.html).
